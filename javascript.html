          <h1>JavaScript</h1><!-- change to header for page -->
          <p>You probably are familiar with the dynamic nature of websites, like hovering the mouse over a navigation link and seeing a drop-down menu appear, or typing text into a search bar and seeing results appear. These action are possible because of JavaScript. Without it, the web wouldn't be so exciting.</p>

          <h2>JavaScript is Born</h2>
          <p>Back in the 1990s, the most popular internet browser was made by Netscape. They wanted to make the web more dynamic and began a project originally called Mocha. Brendan Eich was brought in to develop it. Sun Microsystems, the developer of the Java language, partnered with Netscape to hopefully bring Java to the web. It was deemed too complex for web use, and instead a scripting language to be a companion for Java is what was decided upon.</p>
          <p>Because of the desire for Mocha to have a relationship with Java, it had many similarities, like syntax and symantics, but at the root was very different. In May of 1995, Mocha was built into the Netscape browser.</p>

          <h2>Name Changes and Competition</h2>
          <p>The name of the project went from Mocha to LiveScript, and when Netscape and Sun finally reached a deal, JavaScript. This seemed very appropriate, as it was supposed to be a complimentary scripting language for Java.</p>
          <p>In the mean time, Microsoft wanted to gain control of the web browser market and created Internet Explorer and JScript. JScript was similar to JavaScript, but the two were not always compatible.</p>
